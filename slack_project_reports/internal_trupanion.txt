This is the project progress report for trupanion:

*Staging Site Overwrite:*
    *   The staging site was overwritten with the production site, mirroring production including login credentials.
*Plugins and Licensing:*
    *   Some WordPress plugins may not function fully in staging due to missing environment licenses, potentially causing limited functionality or error messages.
*API Connections:*
    *   Staging uses PRODUCTION APIs, so testing could impact live systems. Exercise caution during testing; GA4 and a few others might be excluded.
*Test vs Staging:*
    *   A separate "test" environment exists but is not being overwritten. Staging is preferred for work as it can be easily reset.
*Access Information:*
    *   The staging site is live and password protected.
        *   Website: trupanionstg.wpenginepowered.com
        *   Gate username: `trupanionstg`
        *   Gate password: ********* (lastpass)
        *   Admin login: trupanionstg.wpenginepowered.com/wp-admin
    *   Use previously provided admin login credentials after passing the gate.
*Overall Scope:*
    *   **Tracking Audit (Week 1):**
        *   Review GA4 setup.
        *   Audit Google Tag Manager (GTM) configuration and event tracking.
        *   Evaluate existing event tagging and misattribution issues.
        *   Identify misattribution or gaps in tracking, especially in the quote journey, activation journey, call-to-action buttons, and unassigned traffic.
    *   **Tracking Fixes and Improvements Implementation (Week 2 to 3):**
        *   Configure server-side tagging via Stape.io, including Stape container and subdomain setup, integration with GA4, and integration with Google Ads (and optionally Meta, if relevant).
        *   Implement code changes to push required events to the DataLayer.
        *   Migrate key events from client-side to server-side GTM where applicable, including quote form submissions, activation steps, and conversion events.
        *   Ensure proper user and session attribution.
    *   **Recommendations & Documentation (Week 3):**
        *   Document the fixes and GTM/GA4 configurations.
        *   Recommend future enhancements for server-side tracking and potential A/B testing strategies.

        *   Value: 2600:1901:0:1ef6::
*Client Developer:*
    *   The client does not have a dedicated developer, so technical requests should be minimized.
*Tracking Audit (Week 1) - Status:*
    *   Review GA4 setup: Complete.
    *   Audit Google Tag Manager (GTM) configuration and event tracking: Complete.
    *   Evaluate existing event tagging and misattribution issues: Requires adherence to Standard UTM tracking guide.

        *   Activation journey: Initially not tracked.
        *   Call-to-action buttons: Initially not tracked.
        *   Unassigned traffic causes: Non-standard UTM parameters in Google Ads destination URLs.
*Tracking Fixes and Improvements Implementation (Week 2 to 3) - Status:*
    *   Configure server-side tagging via Stape.io:
        *   Stape container: Set up.
        *   Subdomain setup: Requires assistance from the client's infrastructure team. DNS records provided.
        *   Integration with GA4 via server container: Complete.
        *   Integration with Google Ads: Complete.
    *   Implementation of Code Changes to push required events to the DataLayer: Complete.

*Recommendations & Documentation (Week 3) - Status:*
    *   Document the fixes and GTM/GA4 configurations: Not Done.
    *   Recommend future enhancements for server-side tracking and potential A/B testing strategies: Not Done.
*Internal Meeting:*
    *   An internal meeting was scheduled to discuss the project.
*To-Do Items:*
    *   Send standard UTM tracking guide to the client.
    *   Investigate and resolve any remaining unassigned traffic issues.
    *   Send a project update to the client.
*Client Request:*
    *   The client has requested an explanation of how to use events correctly to track goals, including recommendations for which events to mark as conversions. The recommendation is to initially mark the final step in each multi-step form as a key event.
*Data Layer Issue:*
    *   The `custom_event` pushed to the dataLayer for each form step is triggering multiple times, causing the corresponding tag to fire more than once. This should only fire once per step.
*Data Layer Issue Resolution:*
    *   The multiple firing of the `custom_event` is being investigated and addressed.
*Unassigned Traffic:*
    *   Improvements and changes to the setup have been implemented to address the unassigned traffic issue. Monitoring is ongoing.
    *   Significant drop in unassigned traffic after the changes. Further improvement is expected.
*Funnel Breakdown:*
    *   A breakdown of all steps in the funnel for all three forms is available.
*Client Validation Start Date:*
    *   Client should start validating from June 7th onwards.
*GA4 Audit:*
    *   GA4 and Google Ads need to be reviewed to ensure everything in scope is completed.
*Trupanion Backend Credentials:*
    *   Updated credentials for Trupanion Backend are required.
*Explore Report for Main Events:*
    *   Create an explore report for the main events to help compare with the source of truth.
*GA4 Configuration Issues:*
    *   Events in GA4 are not solely from the active Google Tag Manager container.
    *   Custom events are set up directly within GA4.
    *   Two GTM containers are on the site:
        *   `GTM-NLZTZRKF` - Actively used for tracking.
        *   `GTM-5P79ND2` - Not accessible or in use.
*Google Ads Update:*
    *   Final GTM updates were made on June 11, 2025.
    *   The discrepancy between Google Ads and GA4 conversions is decreasing.
*Recommendations for GA4 and GTM:*
    *   Remove all existing custom event setups within GA4 that are not linked to the active GTM implementation.
    *   Disable or remove the second GTM container (`GTM-5P79ND2`) from the site.
*GTM, GA4 and Google Ads Cleanup:*
    *   GTM, GA4 and Google Ads cleanup to make sure the old redundant events are no longer being tracked is partially done. Some events are paused but some are still coming through. This would make it difficult for the end user from a usability perspective.
*GA4 and GTM Recommendations Implementation:*
    *   Implementation of recommendations for GA4 and GTM has been approved.

*June 13-14, 2025:*
    *   Conversion Data:
        *   Google Analytics 4:
            *   purchase: 4
            *   step_4_offer_confirmed: 1
        *   Google Ads:
            *   Quotation Purchase: 6
            *   Offer Confirmed: 2
            *   Policy Confirmed: 1
    *   *Note:* Conversion data is expected to improve over time.

*Client Data Discrepancy Report (June 9-15, 2025):*
    *   Discrepancies exist between GA4 data and client's internal reporting for the period of June 9-15:
        *   GA4:
            *   115 quote purchase (quote)
            *   118 offer confirmed (EDO or GHDO)
            *   26 policy confirmed (Continue cover activation)
        *   Client Reporting:
            *   23 enrolled outside of EDO and GHDO (15 via form, rest phone)
            *   100 enrolments for GHDO trial (88 via form, others via phone)
            *   45 enrolments for EDO trial
