*   **Lead Docket Access:** Verify if hits are coming from GTM; Lead Docket access may be required.
*   **Lead Docket Integration:** Juvo leads are set up to go into Lead Docket. CallRail only tracks leads entered into the system.
*   **Custom Image Setup:** Published, awaiting data verification. Emails are currently hashed.
*   **Data Appending:** Another column should be appended. The `uid` is hashed, and the `email` is plain.
*   **CallRail Data:** CallRail data pulled into BigQuery along with other data sources.
    *   BigQuery table for fetching all integration data: lively-welder-457915-j0.Call_rails.fetch_all_integeration_data
    *   Call recordings have been fetched and put in the following table: lively-welder-457915-j0.Call_rails.single_call_recordings
*   **Juvo Data:** Juvo data is integrated with Lead Docket data. Stitch GA4, Lead Docket, and CallRail data. Juvo chat data is available in Lead Docket.
*   **GA4 Form Submission:** GA4 passing form submit with hashed PII.
    *   Event name: *consultation_form_submit*
    *   Event parameters:
        *   email_hashed
        *   phone_hashed
*   **CallRail Recordings:** Call recordings contain links, not transcripts. Transcripts (string/text) are required.
*   **GSC Average Position Discrepancy:** The average position in the Looker Studio report does not match the UI. The following formula should be used in the report to match the UI:  SUM(position * impressions) / SUM(impressions).
*   **GSC Data Requirement:** The page data table is also required, in addition to the query dimension data already provided.
*   **Dashboard Creation:** Recommendation to create a simple dashboard for client review.
*   **Wireframe:** A wireframe exists and will be reviewed for gaps before sharing with the client.
*   **GSC Validation Query:**
    ```sql
    SELECT
      SUM(clicks) AS total_clicks,
      SUM(impressions) AS total_impressions
    FROM
      `lively-welder-457915-j0.search_console_data.michicanautolaw_search_console_data_byPage`
    WHERE
      DATE(date) BETWEEN '2024-01-29' AND '2024-04-30'
      AND page = "<https://www.michiganautolaw.com/blog/2022/09/21/michigan-teen-driving-laws/>"
    ```
*   **Attribution Model Summary:**
    *   **Overview:** Combining data from GA4, CallRail, and Juvo to create a unified list of leads.
    *   **How It Works:**
        *   *Data Matching:* Calls are matched with GA4 using a unique call ID and tracking phone number. Chat sessions are connected using email and phone numbers where form submissions include email and phone details in GA4.
        *   *Lead Definition:* A lead is defined as a client interaction (call, chat, or form submission). Only the first interaction is considered the lead.
        *   Captures marketing source/medium from first and last interactions, lead qualification status, and responses to "How did you hear about us?".
*   **Attribution Model Review Points:**
    *   Investigate potential data mismatches or missing data between GA4 and other platforms (CallRail, Juvo). Specifically, check for leads, chats, or calls available on the platforms but not found in GA4. Juvo chat was missing data, as it joins GA4 on email/phone, and GA4 gets email/phone upon form submission, and it's possible for a client to chat but not submit a form. CallRail will be checked too.
    *   Determine if non-digital values exist in the "How did you hear about us" column. This information is extracted from the conversation. Will clean and create a case statement for digital/non-digital.
    *   The query should create a table, not a view.
    *   The output table needs to be in the specified format: Lead Name | First Click | Last Click | How did you hear about us | Qualified/ Non-Qualified.
    *   Consider joining on client ID for Juvo and GA4 for users who chatted but didn't submit a form. Already joined on client ID too using server side table, but the table has limited data (under 100 rows with client id)
*   **Client ID Population:** New/recent client IDs are not populating from the server table; this requires investigation.
*   **Client Information Request:** Request for first and last name data.
*   **GTM Container Verification:** Client IDs are displaying correctly in the GTM container.
*   **Marketing Attribution Table:** Table created: `lively-welder-457915-j0.ML_Views.MAL_Marketing_Attribution`. Will be linked with Looker to create a basic view.
*   **Sample Dashboard:** A sample dashboard is available.
*   **Looker Studio Access:** Viewing access has been granted to hello@webprogeeks.com.
*   **Lead Docket in BigQuery:** Lead Docket data is confirmed to be in BigQuery.
*   **Lead Docket Data:** Lead Docket contains chat data (complete chat conversation, timestamp, user name, email, phone, agent name, source, etc.) but no revenue information.
*   **Project Status (SoW):**
    *   **Approach:**
        1.  *Non-branded Search Term Analysis:* Data available; page needs to be added to the dashboard per the wireframe. Task is now complete.
        2.  *Non-branded Search Term Analysis Focused on Google Map Performance:* Data available; page needs to be added to the dashboard per the wireframe. Includes:
            *   All Location Trend
            *   All Location Monthly Performance
            *   Single Location Trend (for each location)
            *   Single Location Trend Monthly Performance (for each location)
        3.  *Google Business Profile Pages for each location:* Data available; page needs to be added to the dashboard per the wireframe.
        4.  *Google Analytics Performance with Filters and Estimations:* Data available; page needs to be added to the dashboard per the wireframe (Google Analytics Insights). Task is now complete. Branded clicks are excluded.
        5.  *Custom Marketing Attribution Model:* Complete.
            *   Data Collection Pipeline from Lead Docket to BigQuery: Complete.
            *   Advanced Data Modelling for Attribution: Complete.
            *   Automated engineering pipeline for GA4, GSC, GBP, and CRM data: Complete.
            *   Monthly Reporting Template changes: Not Done.
    *   **Deliverables:**
        *   Data Collection & Pipeline from Lead Docket API/Webhook to BQ: Complete.
        *   Advanced Modelled Data in BQ: Complete.
        *   Advance Dashboard as per provided Mockups: In Progress. All data is available.
    *   **Wireframe:** Available at <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ic6exaVnku7ftFY5HHOIBt87HvZW3uHW/edit?pli=1&tab=t.0>. Screenshots of missing pages are also available.
*   **Branded/Non-Branded Search Terms:** A recording is available explaining how to separate branded and non-branded terms.
*   **Looker Studio Update:** Google Analytics Insights page (2nd last) in Looker Studio has been updated, including the query.
    *   Query: <https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?ws=!1m7!1m6!12m5!1m3!1slively-welder-457915-j0!2sus-central1!3sd24ba2d5-6271-4414-96dc-7fb0e5bdaae0!2e1>
*   **GSC Data Stitching Limitation:** GSC data does not have pages and query (keyword) in a single table, and therefore cannot be linked with GA4 to exclude branded sessions.
*   **GSC Historical Data:** Historical GSC data has been dumped to BigQuery.
    *   Table: lively-welder-457915-j0.search_console_data.michiganautolaw_search_console_data_byQuery_Page
    *   Automation of this process is scheduled for tomorrow.
*   **Client Meeting:** A client meeting is scheduled for Friday at 7:30 PM.
*   **GSC Historical Data Table:** The historical data table for the new requirements is available.
    *   Table: lively-welder-457915-j0.search_console_data.michiganautolaw_search_console_data_byQuery_Landing_Page
*   **Looker Studio:** Multiple new, potentially repetitive pages have been added to the Looker Studio report.
*   **Next Steps:**
    *   Improve navigation across the dashboard and optimize slow-loading pages.
    *   Review the dashboard (especially the new pages) and provide feedback or schedule a follow-up call for next week.
    *   Coordinate with Lead Docket to share more information.
    *   Implement necessary changes once the full Lead Docket data is received to ensure the Leads and Cases data aligns with what’s coming from Lead Docket.
    *   Final review call and sign off upon completion of the above steps.
*   **Target Sign-Off:** Aim to get a sign-off today.
