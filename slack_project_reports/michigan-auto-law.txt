*   **Dashboard Creation:** <@U062ZUFKZ40> to create a simple client dashboard. Model needs to be checked for gaps before sharing with client.
*   **Attribution Model Summary:** Attribution model summarized explanation for client:
    *   *Overview:* Combining data from GA4, CallRail, and Juvo to create a unified list of leads.
    *   *How It Works:*
        *   *Data Matching:* Calls are matched with GA4 using a unique call ID and tracking phone number. Chat sessions are connected using email and phone numbers, where form submissions include email and phone details in GA4.
        *   *Lead Definition:* A lead is defined as a client interaction (call, chat, or form submission). Only the first interaction is considered the lead.
        *   The code captures the marketing source and medium from the first and last interactions and provides the lead qualification status and responses to "How did you hear about us?".
    *   Query Link: <https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?ws=!1m7!1m6!12m5!1m3!1slively-welder-457915-j0!2sus-central1!3sb79b0fd1-0827-4558-8d2a-1ca989f2e915!2e1>
*   **Attribution Model Review:**
    *   <@U07E444U7J4> to check for leads, chats, or calls available on the relevant platform but missing from GA4.
    *   Determine if non-digital values exist in the "How did you hear about us" column for digital/non-digital segregation.
    *   The query should create a table, not a view.
    *   The output table should include columns for Lead Name, First Click, Last Click, How did you hear about us, and Qualified/Non-Qualified.
*   **Juvo Chat Data:** Juvo chat data may be missing from GA4 due to the GA4 join being based on email/phone, which are only captured on form submissions.
*   **"How did you hear about us" Data:** "How did you hear about us" data is extracted from the entire conversation. A case statement will be created to clean and categorize this data as digital/non-digital.
*   **Internal Meeting:** <@UUQ5TDAM6> and <@U07E444U7J4> to join an internal meeting.
*   **Lead Name Data:** Request to include First and Last Name in the data.
*   **Form Name Fields:** The name field will be passed as a parameter that combines both first name and last name for forms with only a single name field.
*   **Marketing Attribution Table:** <@U062ZUFKZ40> created table: `lively-welder-457915-j0.ML_Views.MAL_Marketing_Attribution`. Query link remains the same.
*   **Sample Dashboard:** Sample dashboard link: <https://lookerstudio.google.com/s/v-bJ8JmQq44>
*   **GBP Data Automation:**
    *   GBP data automation was not working.
    *   All pipelines are now confirmed to be functioning.
*   **Webprogeeks Access:** Viewing access shared with <mailto:hello@webprogeeks.com|hello@webprogeeks.com>.
*   **Internal Meeting:** An internal meeting is scheduled (date unspecified).
*   **Lead Docket Data Usage:** Lead Docket data is in BigQuery and is being used for Juvo chat data. It contains chat conversations, timestamps, user name, email, phone, agent name, and source, but no revenue information.
*   **Project Status (per SoW):**
    *   *Approach:*
        *   Non-branded Search Term Analysis: Data available; page to be added to dashboard by <@U07E444U7J4>.
        *   Non-branded Search Term Analysis Focused on Google Map Performance: Data available; page to be added to dashboard by <@U07E444U7J4>. Includes: All Location Trend, All Location Monthly Performance, Single Location Trend (for each location), Single Location Trend Monthly Performance (for each location).
        *   Google Business Profile Pages for each location: Data available; page to be added to dashboard by <@U07E444U7J4>.
        *   Google Analytics Performance with Filters and Estimations: Data available; page to be added to dashboard by <@U07E444U7J4>.
        *   Custom Marketing Attribution Model: Complete. Includes: Data Collection Pipeline from Lead Docket to BigQuery, Advanced Data Modelling for Attribution, and building automated engineering pipeline for GA4, GSC, GBP and CRM data. Monthly Reporting Template changes are not done.
    *   *Deliverables:*
        *   Data Collection & Pipeline from Lead Docket API/Webhook to BQ: Complete.
        *   Advanced Modelled Data in BQ: Complete.
        *   Advance Dashboard as per provided Mockups: In Progress; data available, <@U07E444U7J4> is working on it.
    *   *Wireframe:* [https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ic6exaVnku7ftFY5HHOIBt87HvZW3uHW/edit?pli=1&tab=t.0]
*   **Branded/Non-Branded Separation:** <@U07E444U7J4> reviewed a recording on branded/non-branded separation.
*   **Google Analytics Insights Page:** Google Analytics Insights page (2nd last) on Looker Studio is complete. Query: <https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?ws=!1m7!1m6!12m5!1m3!1slively-welder-457915-j0!2sus-central1!3sd24ba2d5-6271-4414-96dc-7fb0e5bdaae0!2e1>
*   **GSC/GA4 Data Stitching Limitation:** GSC data does not have pages and query (keyword) in a single table, which limits linking with GA4 to exclude branded sessions.
*   **GSC Historical Data:** Historical GSC data dumped to BigQuery at <https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery?ws=!1m5!1m4!4m3!1slively-welder-457915-j0!2ssearch_console_data!3smichiganautolaw_search_console_data_byQuery_Page>. Automation to be implemented tomorrow.
