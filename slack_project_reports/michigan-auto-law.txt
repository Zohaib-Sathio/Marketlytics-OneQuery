*   Attribution model explanation for the client:
    *   Data from GA4, CallRail, and Juvo is being combined to create a unified list of leads.
    *   Calls are matched with GA4 using call ID and tracking phone number. Chat sessions are connected using email and phone numbers, where form submissions include email and phone details in GA4.
    *   A lead is defined as a client interaction (call, chat, or form submission). Only the first interaction is considered the lead.
    *   Marketing source and medium from the first and last interactions are captured. Lead qualification status and "How did you hear about us?" responses are also included.
*   Issues and requirements for the attribution model:
    *   Verify if any leads, chats, or calls available on relevant platforms are missing in GA4.
    *   Determine if non-digital values exist in the "How did you hear about us" column for segregation of digital and non-digital marketing sources.
    *   The query is creating a view; it should create a table instead.
    *   Output table should contain the following columns: Lead Name, First Click, Last Click, How did you hear about us, Qualified/Non-Qualified. First and Last Name are also required.
*   Juvo chat data was missing due to the GA4 join on email/phone, which requires a form submission. CallRail will also be checked for missing data.
*   "How did you hear about us" data will be extracted from the conversation and categorized into digital/non-digital using a case statement.
*   Table created for marketing attribution: `lively-welder-457915-j0.ML_Views.MAL_Marketing_Attribution`. It will be linked to Looker to create a basic view.
*   Sample dashboard link shared.
*   All pipelines are now confirmed to be working.
