I’ll continue to monitor and share more data, but here are the current numbers:\n• *June 12*\n    ◦ Google Ads: 69\n    ◦ GA4: 48\n• *June 13*\n    ◦ Google Ads: 25\n    ◦ GA4: 26\n*Recommendation:*\nSince the client is unsure about what to track and has given us the freedom to decide, I suggest the following:\n• *Remove* all existing _custom event setups_ within GA4 that aren’t linked to our GTM implementation.\n• *Disable or remove* the second GTM container (`GTM-5P79ND2`) from the site.\nThat way, the only events flowing into GA4 will be the ones we explicitly track via `GTM-NLZTZRKF`, ensuring full control and consistency.

The change involved pushing tracking information to the *dataLayer* during the final step of the quote process. This was solely intended to enhance analytics tracking and did not touch the breed dropdown or any other input fields. Everything was tested after deployment and appeared to be functioning as expected.\n\nThat said, we understand the issue you encountered occurred around the same time. While we don’t believe our update directly caused it, we recognize that something may have inadvertently slipped through.\n\nSince we don’t have access to server logs, it’s challenging to confirm the root cause from our side. That said, we’re more than happy to assist in your investigation however we can. Please let us know if there’s anything specific you’d like us to look into.\n\n<@U02DFPYBV2N> for visibility",
